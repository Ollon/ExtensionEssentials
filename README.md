  # Extension Essentials 2017
------------------------------------

The easiest way to set up Visual Studio for the ultimate development experience. Requires Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or newer.

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and road map.

## Extensions
After installing the Web Essentials and restarting
Visual Studio, the following extensions will be installed:

- [Add New File](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3f820e99-6c0d-41db-aa74-a18d9623b1f3)


## Installing
It doesn't take long to install the extensions. Probably less
than a minute. The progress is shown in the new Task Status Center in the left corner of the Status Bar.

When installation is done you will be prompted to restart
Visual Studio. After the restart, all the extensions are
fully functional and ready to use.

## Reset Web Essentials
If you've uninstalled any of the extensions installed by Web Essentials, then those extensions won't be installed again automatically.

To reset this behavior go to _Tools -> Web Essentials..._

![Tools menu](art/tools-menu.png)

This will show the Activity Log for Web Essentials.

From here you can reset the extension. This will attempt to install any of the extensions previously uninstall or for other reasons are not currently installed.
